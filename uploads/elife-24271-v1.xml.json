Our studies at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction indicate that many synaptic defects in <i>unc-104-null</i> mutants are mediated independently of Unc-104\u2019s transport function, via the Wallenda (Wnd)/DLK MAP kinase axonal damage signaling pathway. Wnd signaling becomes activated when Unc-104\u2019s function is disrupted, and leads to impairment of synaptic structure and function by restraining the expression level of active zone (AZ) and synaptic vesicle (SV) components. This action concomitantly suppresses the buildup of synaptic proteins in neuronal cell bodies, hence may play an adaptive role to stresses that impair axonal transport. Wnd signaling also becomes activated when pre-synaptic proteins are over-expressed, suggesting the existence of a feedback circuit to match synaptic protein levels to the transport capacity of the axon."

Our studies at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction indicate that many synaptic defects in <i>unc-104-null</i> mutants are mediated independently of Unc-104\u2019s transport function, via the Wallenda (Wnd)/DLK MAP kinase axonal damage signaling pathway. Wnd signaling becomes activated when Unc-104\u2019s function is disrupted, and leads to impairment of synaptic structure and function by restraining the expression level of active zone (AZ) and synaptic vesicle (SV) components. This action concomitantly suppresses the buildup of synaptic proteins in neuronal cell bodies, hence may play an adaptive role to stresses that impair axonal transport. Wnd signaling also becomes activated when pre-synaptic proteins are over-expressed, suggesting the existence of a feedback circuit to match synaptic protein levels to the transport capacity of the axon."

The signaling pathway, which is conserved between flies and humans, involves an enzyme that is called Wnd in flies and DLK in humans.

This reduction matches the neuron\u2019s reduced ability to transport them along the axon, and may help the neuron to adapt when axonal transport is impaired.

In contrast to postsynaptic receptors, whose trafficking and organization has been studied extensively in many different synapse types (<a href=\"#bib16\">Choquet and Triller, 2013</a>), much less is known about the mechanisms that regulate the assembly and maintenance of the neurotransmitter release machinery in the presynaptic neuron. This machinery includes the active zone (AZ), an electron-dense complex of structural proteins that scaffold both calcium channels and synaptic vesicles (SV) for the coordination of calcium-regulated exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib91\">S\u00fcdhof, 2012</a>). The protein components of the AZ are synthesized in cell bodies and trafficked together in association with vesicles (known as piccolo-bassoon transport vesicles (PTVs) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmari et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Maas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Shapira et al., 2003</a>). SV precursors are also synthesized in cell bodies, and carried by kinesin motors to synapses (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hall and Hedgecock, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Okada et al., 1995</a>).

The Wnd/DLK mixed lineage kinase has recently received intense interest for its roles in regulating both regenerative and degenerative responses to axonal damage in vertebrate and invertebrate neurons (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gerdts et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hao and Collins, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Li and Collins, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Tedeschi and Bradke, 2013</a>). We found that the Wnd/DLK signaling pathway becomes activated when Unc-104\u2019s function is impaired, and then promotes synaptic dysfunction by restraining expression of multiple pre-synaptic AZ and SV protein components. This restraint concomitantly reduces protein buildup in cell bodies, which may play an adaptive role to stresses that disrupt intracellular transport, and contribute to pathologies that arise when transport is disrupted."

At the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ), <i>unc-104-null</i> mutants are severely defective in the formation of presynaptic boutons, fail to localize SVs to NMJ terminals and show strong reductions in AZ localization (<a href=\"#bib76\">Pack-Chung et al., 2007</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We found that disrupting the axonal damage signaling kinase Wnd (<i>wnd<sup>3</sup></i> single mutants) had no significant effect on bouton formation, AZ number, or presynaptic protein localization, but double mutants with <i>unc-104-null</i> alleles (<i>unc-104<sup>P350</sup></i>, <i>unc-104<sup>170</sup>,</i> and <i>unc-104<sup>52</sup></i>), gave a very informative phenotype: in <i>unc-104<sup>null</sup>;wnd<sup>3/3</sup></i> double mutants the synaptic bouton formation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and C</a>), AZ number (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and D</a>), and synaptic levels of the AZ protein Brp (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and E</a>) were restored to a wild type phenotype. In contrast, the synaptic levels of SV proteins (VGlut, SytI and CSP) remained negligible, as in the <i>unc-104<sup>null</sup></i> single mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and E</a>). These results are consistent with previous findings that Unc-104 functions as an essential molecular motor to transport SV precursors to synaptic terminals. However our findings indicate that transport of AZ precursors and bouton formation can occur independently of Unc-104. These defects are mediated by a second and separable mechanism, which depends upon the function of the Wnd kinase."

By immunocytochemistry (IHC) with anti-Wnd antibodies, Wnd protein remained below the detection threshold in both wild type and <i>unc-104</i> mutant animals (data not shown). Therefore, to further evaluate potential effects upon Wnd protein we utilized two different wnd-GFP fusion proteins. First, a MiMIC-<i>wnd</i>-GFP line (<a href=\"#bib97\">Venken et al., 2011</a>), in which a GFP tag is inserted via an exon trap within the <i>wnd</i> genomic locus, creates another tool for detecting Wnd as expressed from its endogenous promoter. We verified that Wnd protein from this line was expressed and tagged (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By IHC, this reagent revealed Wnd enrichment in neuronal cell bodies in <i>unc-104</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and E</a>). Second, an ectopically expressed UAS-GFP-<i>wnd<sup>KD</sup></i> transgene (which was kinase dead to avoid pathway activation) has been established as a sensitive method to detect Wnd protein change (<a href=\"#bib17\">Collins et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hao et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Xiong et al., 2010</a>). This highly expressed transgene also revealed an increase in cell body localized Wnd in <i>unc-104</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D and F</a>). This correlation of Wnd localization with signaling activation is interesting to note, since Wnd and its DLK homologue are known to physically associate with vesicles that are transported in axons (<a href=\"#bib40\">Holland et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Xiong et al., 2010</a>), and this transport appears to be important for its ability to mediate axon-to-cell\u00a0body retrograde signaling."

Previous work has suggested that other presumed cargo of Unc-104, including Liprin-\u03b1, Rab3 and Rab3-GEF, play important early roles in AZ assembly (<a href=\"#bib31\">Graf et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Niwa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Shin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">S\u00fcdhof, 2012</a>). We therefore asked whether defects in these synaptic \u2018cargos\u2019 of Unc-104 led to activation of Wnd signaling. We observed that <i>liprin-\u03b1</i> mutant NMJs contain a large portion of unapposed GluRIII-labeled PSDs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), resembling the defects in <i>unc-104</i> mutants. Similar defects were reported for <i>rab3</i> and <i>rab3-gef</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Graf et al., 2009</a>). However, in contrast to <i>unc-104</i>, the <i>liprin-\u03b1</i> and <i>rab3</i> synaptic defects were not suppressed by mutations in <i>wnd</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013I</a>). Furthermore, the increased Brp intensity per AZ and reduced AZ number due to <i>liprin-\u03b1</i> and <i>rab3</i> mutations was not suppressed by <i>wnd</i> mutations (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In fact, the Brp intensity per AZ was slightly enhanced in <i>liprin-\u03b1;wnd</i> double mutants. These data suggest that Liprin-\u03b1 and Rab3 regulate presynaptic assembly via pathways that are either independent or downstream of Wnd, and that defects in synapse assembly and structure per se do not cause activation of Wnd signaling."

Indeed, over-expression of <i>wnd</i> alone in motoneurons resulted in cell-autonomous presynaptic defects that are comparable to <i>unc-104</i> mutants. First, many individual synapses (identified by GluRIII puncta) lacked Brp (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and C</a>), and synapses that contained Brp had reduced Brp intensity, which resulted in a global 70% reduction in Brp intensity across the entire NMJ terminal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Second, mEJP frequency, along with other aspects of synaptic transmission (amplitude of EJP and mEJP), was significantly impaired (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013I</a>). Third, synaptic localization of SV-associated proteins, measured by VGlut intensity within NMJ terminals, was also reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#bib17\">Collins et al., 2006</a>). Taken together with the rescue of <i>unc-104</i> synaptic defects by <i>wnd</i> mutations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>), these data indicate that activation of Wnd signaling leads to strong perturbations in presynaptic structure and function."

We found that <i>hiw</i> mutants displayed strikingly similar presynaptic defects to <i>unc-104</i> mutants or overexpression of Wnd (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a>). These included 60% of synapses lacking the AZ proteins Brp, Liprin-\u03b1 and Cac (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B and E</a>), a reduction of total Brp intensity at individual synapses and across the NMJ terminal (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>), a reduction in VGlut intensity at the NMJ terminal (<a href=\"#bib17\">Collins et al., 2006</a>), and reduced mEJP frequency (<a href=\"#bib17\">Collins et al., 2006</a>) and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). All these presynaptic defects were rescued by <i>wnd</i> mutations.

Strikingly, <i>wnd</i> mutations enhanced this phenotype: SV and AZ components were dramatically increased in cell bodies of <i>unc-104; wnd</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C,E</a>, and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

However, they may be explained by an action of the Wnd pathway within a feedback circuit to reduce the build-up of SV and AZ components in neuronal cell bodies. As a nuclear signaling cascade, we hypothesized that Wnd signaling may achieve this effect by down-regulating the expression levels of SV and AZ components. In this case, such reduction in global levels could account for the reduced levels at synaptic terminals in <i>unc-104</i> mutants. To test this hypothesis, we carried out quantitative immunohistochemistry to estimate the total cellular levels of Brp and VGlut in motoneurons based on respective intensities in cell body, axonal and synaptic compartments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). We found that compared with wildtype animals, the total levels of Brp and VGlut are reduced by 65% and 80% respectively in <i>unc-104</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). The total levels of both proteins were restored in <i>unc-104; wnd</i> double mutants, with increases observed in all of the compartments (cell bodies, axons, and synapses). (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). We suspect that the fact that motoneurons are only a fraction of neurons in the <i>Drosophila</i> nervous system prohibited our detection of global changes in these proteins by Western blot (data not shown). However we observed this trend in total levels of VGlut (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This may be facilitated by the fact that most of the glutamatergic neurons in larval VNCs are motoneurons."

This response may serve to counteract their buildup in neuronal cell bodies while causing the observed defects in synapse structure and function. In support of this, <i>unc-104</i> mutations led to decreased expression of a <i>vglut</i>-DsRed transcriptional reporter in motoneurons, in a Wnd-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G and H</a>). This, together with the involvement of transcription factor Fos in restraining VGlut and Brp buildup in cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), implies that Wnd signaling may inhibit presynaptic protein expression at the transcriptional level."

We investigated this more carefully via analysis of <i>wnd-null</i> mutants during embryonic stages of axonal outgrowth and synapse formation (during embryonic stages 14 through 17), and observed that NMJ synapse development progressed normally (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

While these synaptic defects have been considered logical outcomes of defective transport, we found that major aspects, including impaired AZ addition and development of synaptic boutons, are not mediated by a direct transport role for the Unc-104 protein. Rather, the <i>unc-104<sup>null</sup>;wnd</i> double mutants reveal separable functions for Unc-104: (1) Transport of SV precursors to synaptic terminals is likely a direct function, since the failure to deliver adequate VGlut, Syt1 and CSP persists in <i>unc-104<sup>null</sup>;wnd</i> double mutants, and the Unc-104 homologue KIF1A physically interacts with SV precursors (<a href=\"#bib74\">Okada et al., 1995</a>). (2) Regulation of bouton formation and localization of AZs is an indirect function, since this defect can be rescued in <i>unc-104<sup>null</sup>;wnd</i> double mutants (in the complete absence of Unc-104 function)."

It now becomes likely that these defects are mediated by Wnd/DLK, since Wnd/DLK signaling has previously been shown to influence microtubule growth (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hirai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Lewcock et al., 2007</a>), neuronal remodeling (<a href=\"#bib52\">Kurup et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Marcette et al., 2014</a>) and dendrite growth (<a href=\"#bib100\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). <i>Unc-104/Kif1a</i> mutants also show accelerated motor circuit dysfunction in aging animals (<a href=\"#bib58\">Li et al., 2016</a>), impaired BDNF-stimulated synaptogenesis (<a href=\"#bib50\">Kondo et al., 2012</a>) and neuronal death (<a href=\"#bib110\">Yonekawa et al., 1998</a>).

Moreover, many studies have noted a role for DLK signaling in mediating structural changes in neurons downstream of manipulations that disrupt cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bounoutas et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Marcette et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Massaro et al., 2009</a>). Since the cytoskeleton is a closely functioning partner of all motor proteins, and is also implicitly affected by axonal injury, it is possible that these manipulations share a similar underlying mechanism with that of <i>unc-104</i> mutations. While disruption of cytoskeleton should impair transport by many motor proteins, mutations that impair kinesin-1 and dynein do not lead to activation of Wnd (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#bib108\">Xiong et al., 2010</a>). This specificity suggests that disruption of Unc-104 mediated transport, potentially via mislocalization of Unc-104\u2019s cargo, mediates Wnd/DLK\u2019s activation after cytoskeletal disruption and potentially after axonal injury."

These stages correspond to the onset of synaptic protein expression, before substantial transport to synaptic terminals, hence represent a time in which levels are high in the cell body. Consistent with the idea that Wnd signaling is sensitive to mislocalized presynaptic proteins, ectopic overexpression of several different presynaptic proteins caused an elevation in Wnd signaling in uninjured neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). These observations suggest a model that accumulations of presynaptic proteins, as a feature of aberrant cargo transport, are \u2018sensed\u2019 by Wnd signaling (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

SV components are transported in the form of SV precursors (SVPs), while AZ components are thought to be transported via association with dense core vesicles (DCVs) (<a href=\"#bib82\">Shapira et al., 2003</a>). While much remains to be learned about the mechanism by which individual synaptic components are transported, we can infer from this study that the Unc-104 kinesin (black) plays an essential role in the transport of SV components but not AZ components (which may be carried by an additional kinesin, indicated in gray). When Unc-104\u2019s function is impaired/reduced, presynaptic components accumulate in cell bodies. However Wnd signaling activation reduces the accumulations by reducing total expression levels of presynaptic components. This reduction eventually manifests as a reduction in synapse number and mismatched pre- and postsynaptic structures."

To affirm that AZ components were indeed completely absent, confocal settings and brightness levels were optimized for the weakest signals in <i>unc-104</i> mutants. Since the same settings were used for all genotypes some pixels for AZ components were necessarily over-exposed in the wt controls. For measurements of intensity levels, using Volocity software, only raw images acquired together using the same confocal settings were compared. To measure VGlut and Brp levels in axons and NMJs, we used staining for HRP (which labels neuronal membrane) to define the region of interest. For cell bodies, we selected the signal above a specified threshold, (To specify the threshold, we checked the background signal and examined the fluorescence signal distribution from multiple images. The threshold was chosen to be as at least 3 fold higher than the background and 1 SD higher than the center of the distribution. The same threshold was applied to all compared images). To estimate the total VGlut or Brp level within a single motoneuron (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), we summed measurements of: (a) total intensity for individual cell bodies (located in the dorsal midline of the ventral nerve cord), (b) total intensity for individual NMJ nerve terminals at muscle 4, and (c) estimated total intensity within a motoneuron axon, calculated from mean intensity in axonal segments, based on the assumption of 32 motoneuron axons per nerve and an average axon length of 1 mm."

The differentiation between Brp and SV proteins is based on the finding that reduced synaptic levels of Brp in unc-104 nulls are suppressed by wnd but SV protein levels are not, in contrast to their findings in unc-104 hypomorphs. Simpler models should be considered. For example, the observation that wnd suppresses the loss of SV proteins at synapses in hypomorphs with residual Unc-104 activity but not nulls is more easily explained by the model that SV transport, but not Brp transport, is fully dependent on Unc-104, consistent with prior observations in <i>Drosophila</i> (Pack-Chung et al., 2007).."

This is in contrast to results published in an earlier paper with overlapping authors (Collins et al., 2006).

AZ components are reduced at the synaptic terminals of the unc-104 mutants, but their transport has never been shown to be driven directly by unc-104. Through an exhaustive set of experiments (using diverse mutant and RNAi combinations), the authors show that defects in unc-104 lead to the activation of the Wnd signaling pathway (via Bsk and Fos), which in a cell-autonomous manner regulates AZ protein levels in neuronal cell bodies and synaptic terminals. Suppressing Wnd signaling in unc-104 strong hypomorphs or in RNAi knockdowns significantly reduces the defects in AZ at the synapse, defects in synaptic transmission, larval mobility and viability, but only partly rescues SV protein levels. Furthermore, puckered expression and axonal regeneration, both of which require enhanced Wnd signaling, are enhanced in unc-104 mutants."
