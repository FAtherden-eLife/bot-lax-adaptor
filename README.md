# jats-scraper2

The next incarnation of the jats-scraper.

The previous jats-scraper was used to generate the 'EIF' json, used as convenient representation of a subset of article data derived from XML and non-XML sources.

This version of the jats-scraper is intended to:

* produce a complete representaion of a JATS XML article in JSON
* validate result against our evolving JSON Schema article specification
* report any/all problems in scraping
